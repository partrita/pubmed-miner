<p>Despite significant advancements in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a global health challenge due to its high mutation rate, drug resistance, and the complexity of treatment optimization. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in HIV research, offering innovative solutions for predicting viral mutations, optimizing drug discovery and formulation design. However, challenges such as limited access to diverse datasets, ethical concerns, and model interpretability hinder the full potential of AI in HIV research. This review highlights gaps in AI-driven HIV research and explores advancements to address these challenges. AI-driven platforms, such as DeepHIV and geno2pheno, have demonstrated success in forecasting resistance mutations and guiding therapeutic decisions. AI is also revolutionizing drug formulation development by enhancing solubility, bioavailability, and stability, while improving patient adherence through advanced delivery systems. Current applications of AI in HIV mutation prediction, drug discovery, and formulation optimization have highlighted the potential of AI towards HIV management and eradication while addressing gaps in data availability and model transparency. By integrating structural, pharmacological, and clinical data, AI provides a comprehensive framework for rational drug design and personalized treatment strategies. By leveraging AI-driven insights, HIV treatment and prevention can become more personalized, efficient, and sustainable. Future research should focus on overcoming data limitations, enhancing model interpretability, and exploring innovative AI approaches to contribute to the global fight against the HIV epidemic.</p>

<p>Drug discovery is a long, resource-intensive process with high failure rates. Traditional experimental identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is especially time-consuming and costly. This comprehensive review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming DTI prediction, offering substantial potential to reduce drug development time and costs. The review provides a detailed examination of AI/ML-based techniques, detailing data representations for drugs, targets, and their interactions through joint drug-target processing. The review extensively discusses feature extraction and engineering methods, including the construction of interaction-specific features. It also encompasses a broad range of learning paradigms and model architectures, including supervised learning, advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Learning (DL) models, and hybrid approaches. We further examine training protocols and robust evaluation metrics crucial for assessing model generalization. Ultimately, this review highlights the capacity of these advanced AI/ML methods to deliver more accurate, scalable, and interpretable solutions for DTI prediction. This is crucial for accelerating key stages of drug development, including lead compound identification, off-target profiling, drug repurposing, polypharmacology analysis, and the realization of precision medicine.</p>

<p>With the pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and manufacturing of approved or investigational drugs already well-characterized, drug repurposing and repositioning offer emerging strategies to rapidly develop effective treatments for various challenging diseases. However, the growing mass of genetic and multiomics data has not been effectively explored by the drug repurposing community due to a lack of accurate approaches. This review aims to be an authoritative, critical, and accessible review and discussion of general interest to the drug repurposing community concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools. Emerging questions include what is achievable with AI in this domain and what its impact will be, what AI and ML embrace, and how we, as geneticists, pharmacologists, and computational scientists, can contribute to the discovery of new, inexpensive, and affordable repurposable medicines. The fast growth of genetics and multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and radiomics) and electronic health records in diverse populations contributes to answering questions, including how to rapidly identify effective repurposable medicines, what a clinically meaningful effect size in trials is, and what the potential implications for precision medicine are. This review discusses AI and ML for drug repurposing in the context of genetics, multiomics, real-world data collection, and crowdsourcing of knowledge. We conclude by considering questions on how AI and ML methodologies can unite the diverse aspects of translational medicine for emerging treatment development in human-challenging diseases.</p>
