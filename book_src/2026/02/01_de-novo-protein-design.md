<p>Data-driven methodologies have transformed the discovery and prediction of hard materials with well-defined atomic structures by leveraging standardized datasets, enabling accurate property predictions and facilitating efficient exploration of design spaces<sup>1-3</sup>. However, their application to soft materials remains challenging because of complex, multiscale structure-property relationships<sup>4-6</sup>. Here we present a data-driven approach that integrates data mining, experimentation and machine learning to design high-performance adhesive hydrogels from scratch, tailored for demanding underwater environments. By leveraging protein databases, we developed a descriptor strategy to statistically replicate protein sequence patterns in polymer strands by ideal random copolymerization, enabling targeted hydrogel design and dataset construction. Using machine learning, we optimized hydrogel formulations from an initial dataset of 180 bioinspired hydrogels, achieving remarkable improvements in adhesive strength, with a maximum value exceeding 1 MPa. These super-adhesive hydrogels hold immense potential across diverse applications, from biomedical engineering to deep-sea exploration, marking a notable advancement in data-driven innovation for soft materials.</p>

<p>Crops provide food, clothing and other important products for the global population. To meet the demands of a growing population, substantial improvements are required in crop yield, quality and production sustainability. However, these goals are constrained by various environmental factors and limited genetic resources. Overcoming these limitations requires a paradigm shift in crop improvement by fully leveraging natural genetic diversity alongside biotechnological approaches such as genome editing and the heterologous expression of designed proteins, coupled with multimodal data integration. In this Review, we provide an in-depth analysis of integrated uses of omics technologies, genome editing, protein design and high-throughput phenotyping, in crop improvement, supported by artificial intelligence-enabled tools. We discuss the emerging applications and current challenges of these technologies in crop improvement. Finally, we present a perspective on how elite alleles generated through these technologies can be incorporated into the genomes of existing and de novo domesticated crops, aided by a proposed artificial intelligence model. We suggest that integrating these technologies with agricultural practices will lead to a new revolution in crop improvement, contributing to global food security in a sustainable manner.</p>

<p>Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into drug discovery has revolutionized pharmaceutical innovation, addressing the challenges of traditional methods that are costly, time-consuming, and suffer from high failure rates. By utilizing machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), AI enhances various stages of drug development, including target identification, lead optimization, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. AI tools, such as AlphaFold for protein structure prediction and AtomNet for structure-based drug design, have significantly accelerated the discovery process, improved efficiency and reduced costs. Success stories like Insilico Medicine's AI-designed molecule for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and BenevolentAI's identification of baricitinib for COVID-19 highlight AI's transformative potential. Additionally, AI enables the exploration of vast chemical spaces, optimization of clinical trials, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, paving the way for precision medicine. However, challenges such as limited data accessibility, integration of diverse datasets, interpretability of AI models, and ethical concerns remain critical hurdles. Overcoming these limitations through enhanced algorithms, standardized databases, and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential. Overall, AI continues to reshape drug discovery, reducing timelines, increasing success rates, and driving the development of innovative and accessible therapies for unmet medical needs.</p>
