<p>Drug discovery is a long, resource-intensive process with high failure rates. Traditional experimental identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is especially time-consuming and costly. This comprehensive review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming DTI prediction, offering substantial potential to reduce drug development time and costs. The review provides a detailed examination of AI/ML-based techniques, detailing data representations for drugs, targets, and their interactions through joint drug-target processing. The review extensively discusses feature extraction and engineering methods, including the construction of interaction-specific features. It also encompasses a broad range of learning paradigms and model architectures, including supervised learning, advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Learning (DL) models, and hybrid approaches. We further examine training protocols and robust evaluation metrics crucial for assessing model generalization. Ultimately, this review highlights the capacity of these advanced AI/ML methods to deliver more accurate, scalable, and interpretable solutions for DTI prediction. This is crucial for accelerating key stages of drug development, including lead compound identification, off-target profiling, drug repurposing, polypharmacology analysis, and the realization of precision medicine.</p>

<p>With the pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and manufacturing of approved or investigational drugs already well-characterized, drug repurposing and repositioning offer emerging strategies to rapidly develop effective treatments for various challenging diseases. However, the growing mass of genetic and multiomics data has not been effectively explored by the drug repurposing community due to a lack of accurate approaches. This review aims to be an authoritative, critical, and accessible review and discussion of general interest to the drug repurposing community concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools. Emerging questions include what is achievable with AI in this domain and what its impact will be, what AI and ML embrace, and how we, as geneticists, pharmacologists, and computational scientists, can contribute to the discovery of new, inexpensive, and affordable repurposable medicines. The fast growth of genetics and multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and radiomics) and electronic health records in diverse populations contributes to answering questions, including how to rapidly identify effective repurposable medicines, what a clinically meaningful effect size in trials is, and what the potential implications for precision medicine are. This review discusses AI and ML for drug repurposing in the context of genetics, multiomics, real-world data collection, and crowdsourcing of knowledge. We conclude by considering questions on how AI and ML methodologies can unite the diverse aspects of translational medicine for emerging treatment development in human-challenging diseases.</p>

<p>To provide a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in cardiac arrest (CA). Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE from database inception through 10 June 2025. Studies that applied AI in both in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) populations across the following domains were included: prediction of cardiac arrest occurrence, prognostication of CA outcomes, applications of large language models (LLMs), and evaluation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other AI-driven interventions related to CA. The scoping review included 114 studies, encompassing data from 9,574,462 patients in total. AI was most commonly applied to the prediction of CA (overall, <i>n</i>=40; IHCA, <i>n</i>=30; OHCA, <i>n</i>=4; and both, <i>n</i>=6), CPR-related decision support during CA (<i>n</i>=16), and post-arrest prognosis and rehabilitation outcomes (overall, <i>n</i>=38; OHCA, <i>n</i>=21; IHCA, <i>n</i>=3; and both, <i>n</i>=14). Additional application areas included LLM-based applications (<i>n</i>=8), emergency call handling (<i>n</i>=4), wearable device-based detection (<i>n</i>=3), heart rhythm identification (<i>n</i>=2), education (<i>n</i>=2), and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) candidate identification (<i>n</i>=1). Across all application scenarios, the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value for pre-arrest CA prediction in IHCA patients was 0.998 using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, whereas the optimal AUROC for pre-arrest CA prediction in OHCA patients was 0.950 using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) or random forest (RF) models. For CPR-related decision support during CA, the highest AUROC achieved was 0.990 with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. In prognostic prediction, the optimal AUROC for IHCA patients was 0.960 using XGBoost, while for OHCA patients it reached 0.976 using an MLP model. This review shows that AI is most commonly used for the prediction of CA and CPR-related support, as well as post-arrest and rehabilitation outcomes. Future research directions include drug discovery, post-resuscitation management, neurorehabilitation, and clinical trial innovation. Further studies should prioritize multicenter clinical trials to evaluate AI models in real-world settings and validate their effectiveness across diverse patient populations. Overall, AI has significant potential to improve clinical practice, and its role in CA application is increasingly important.</p>
