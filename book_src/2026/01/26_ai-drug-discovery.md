<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Yet, drug discovery for these conditions faces significant challenges due to the complexity and heterogeneity of their underlying pathology. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-particularly explainable AI (XAI)-have emerged as powerful multi-omics data analyzing tools to unravel pathological mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets. However, the application of XAI in cardiovascular drug discovery remains in its infancy. This review discusses the potential for the integration of AI with multi-omics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and repurpose existing drugs for myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF). This review highlights the current gap in leveraging XAI for CVDs and discusses key challenges such as data heterogeneity, model interpretability, and translational validation. This review also describes emerging approaches, including combining AI with mechanistic models, that aim to enhance the biological relevance of AI predictions. By utilizing genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets, AI-driven methods can uncover new biomarkers and predict drug responses with greater precision. The application of AI in analyzing large-scale clinical and molecular data offers significant promise in accelerating drug discovery, refining therapeutic strategies, and improving outcomes for patients with CVDs. This review highlights recent advancements, challenges, and future directions for AI-guided drug discovery in the context of MI and HF.</p>

<p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken machine learning (ML) in molecular design to a new level. As ML increasingly relies on complex deep learning frameworks, the inability to understand predictions of black-box models has become a topical issue. Consequently, there is strong interest in the field of explainable AI (XAI) to bridge the gap between black-box models and the acceptance of their predictions, especially at interfaces with experimental disciplines. Therefore, XAI methods must go beyond extracting learning patterns from ML models and present explanations of predictions in a human-centered, transparent, and interpretable manner. In this Perspective, we examine current challenges and opportunities for XAI in molecular design and evaluate the benefits of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into XAI approaches for model refinement, experimental design, and hypothesis testing. In this context, we also discuss the current limitations in evaluating results from chemical language models that are increasingly used in molecular design and drug discovery.</p>

<p>The global crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) demands a paradigm shift in traditional drug discovery, and artificial intelligence (AI) is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation. We highlight how AI and machine learning (ML) can accelerate the discovery of novel antimicrobials by enabling de novo drug design, virtual screening, identification of new drug targets, and elucidation of antimicrobial mechanisms. Furthermore, AI/ML is revolutionizing resistance prediction by integrating diverse genomic and phenotypic data for rapid diagnostics, real-time surveillance, and personalized antimicrobial therapy. Despite data and the 'black-box' challenge of model interpretability, the potential of AI to combat AMR hinges on sustained investment, data-sharing, and unprecedented interdisciplinary collaboration worldwide. The strategic deployment of AI and ML is thus a crucial element in the battle plan in the war against drug-resistant pathogens.</p>
