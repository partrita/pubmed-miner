<p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken machine learning (ML) in molecular design to a new level. As ML increasingly relies on complex deep learning frameworks, the inability to understand predictions of black-box models has become a topical issue. Consequently, there is strong interest in the field of explainable AI (XAI) to bridge the gap between black-box models and the acceptance of their predictions, especially at interfaces with experimental disciplines. Therefore, XAI methods must go beyond extracting learning patterns from ML models and present explanations of predictions in a human-centered, transparent, and interpretable manner. In this Perspective, we examine current challenges and opportunities for XAI in molecular design and evaluate the benefits of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into XAI approaches for model refinement, experimental design, and hypothesis testing. In this context, we also discuss the current limitations in evaluating results from chemical language models that are increasingly used in molecular design and drug discovery.</p>

<p>Despite significant advancements in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a global health challenge due to its high mutation rate, drug resistance, and the complexity of treatment optimization. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in HIV research, offering innovative solutions for predicting viral mutations, optimizing drug discovery and formulation design. However, challenges such as limited access to diverse datasets, ethical concerns, and model interpretability hinder the full potential of AI in HIV research. This review highlights gaps in AI-driven HIV research and explores advancements to address these challenges. AI-driven platforms, such as DeepHIV and geno2pheno, have demonstrated success in forecasting resistance mutations and guiding therapeutic decisions. AI is also revolutionizing drug formulation development by enhancing solubility, bioavailability, and stability, while improving patient adherence through advanced delivery systems. Current applications of AI in HIV mutation prediction, drug discovery, and formulation optimization have highlighted the potential of AI towards HIV management and eradication while addressing gaps in data availability and model transparency. By integrating structural, pharmacological, and clinical data, AI provides a comprehensive framework for rational drug design and personalized treatment strategies. By leveraging AI-driven insights, HIV treatment and prevention can become more personalized, efficient, and sustainable. Future research should focus on overcoming data limitations, enhancing model interpretability, and exploring innovative AI approaches to contribute to the global fight against the HIV epidemic.</p>

<p>Drug discovery is a long, resource-intensive process with high failure rates. Traditional experimental identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is especially time-consuming and costly. This comprehensive review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming DTI prediction, offering substantial potential to reduce drug development time and costs. The review provides a detailed examination of AI/ML-based techniques, detailing data representations for drugs, targets, and their interactions through joint drug-target processing. The review extensively discusses feature extraction and engineering methods, including the construction of interaction-specific features. It also encompasses a broad range of learning paradigms and model architectures, including supervised learning, advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Learning (DL) models, and hybrid approaches. We further examine training protocols and robust evaluation metrics crucial for assessing model generalization. Ultimately, this review highlights the capacity of these advanced AI/ML methods to deliver more accurate, scalable, and interpretable solutions for DTI prediction. This is crucial for accelerating key stages of drug development, including lead compound identification, off-target profiling, drug repurposing, polypharmacology analysis, and the realization of precision medicine.</p>
