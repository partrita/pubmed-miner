<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Yet, drug discovery for these conditions faces significant challenges due to the complexity and heterogeneity of their underlying pathology. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-particularly explainable AI (XAI)-have emerged as powerful multi-omics data analyzing tools to unravel pathological mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets. However, the application of XAI in cardiovascular drug discovery remains in its infancy. This review discusses the potential for the integration of AI with multi-omics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and repurpose existing drugs for myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF). This review highlights the current gap in leveraging XAI for CVDs and discusses key challenges such as data heterogeneity, model interpretability, and translational validation. This review also describes emerging approaches, including combining AI with mechanistic models, that aim to enhance the biological relevance of AI predictions. By utilizing genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets, AI-driven methods can uncover new biomarkers and predict drug responses with greater precision. The application of AI in analyzing large-scale clinical and molecular data offers significant promise in accelerating drug discovery, refining therapeutic strategies, and improving outcomes for patients with CVDs. This review highlights recent advancements, challenges, and future directions for AI-guided drug discovery in the context of MI and HF.</p>

<p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken machine learning (ML) in molecular design to a new level. As ML increasingly relies on complex deep learning frameworks, the inability to understand predictions of black-box models has become a topical issue. Consequently, there is strong interest in the field of explainable AI (XAI) to bridge the gap between black-box models and the acceptance of their predictions, especially at interfaces with experimental disciplines. Therefore, XAI methods must go beyond extracting learning patterns from ML models and present explanations of predictions in a human-centered, transparent, and interpretable manner. In this Perspective, we examine current challenges and opportunities for XAI in molecular design and evaluate the benefits of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into XAI approaches for model refinement, experimental design, and hypothesis testing. In this context, we also discuss the current limitations in evaluating results from chemical language models that are increasingly used in molecular design and drug discovery.</p>

<p>Despite significant advancements in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a global health challenge due to its high mutation rate, drug resistance, and the complexity of treatment optimization. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in HIV research, offering innovative solutions for predicting viral mutations, optimizing drug discovery and formulation design. However, challenges such as limited access to diverse datasets, ethical concerns, and model interpretability hinder the full potential of AI in HIV research. This review highlights gaps in AI-driven HIV research and explores advancements to address these challenges. AI-driven platforms, such as DeepHIV and geno2pheno, have demonstrated success in forecasting resistance mutations and guiding therapeutic decisions. AI is also revolutionizing drug formulation development by enhancing solubility, bioavailability, and stability, while improving patient adherence through advanced delivery systems. Current applications of AI in HIV mutation prediction, drug discovery, and formulation optimization have highlighted the potential of AI towards HIV management and eradication while addressing gaps in data availability and model transparency. By integrating structural, pharmacological, and clinical data, AI provides a comprehensive framework for rational drug design and personalized treatment strategies. By leveraging AI-driven insights, HIV treatment and prevention can become more personalized, efficient, and sustainable. Future research should focus on overcoming data limitations, enhancing model interpretability, and exploring innovative AI approaches to contribute to the global fight against the HIV epidemic.</p>
