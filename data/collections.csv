Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-particularly explainable AI (XAI)-have emerged as powerful multi-omics data analyzing tools to unravel pathological mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets. However, the application of XAI in cardiovascular drug discovery remains in its infancy. This review discusses the potential for the integration of AI with multi-omics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and repurpose existing drugs for myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF). This review highlights the current gap in leveraging XAI for CVDs and discusses key challenges such as data heterogeneity, model interpretability, and translational validation.

Across all application scenarios, the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value for pre-arrest CA prediction in IHCA patients was 0.998 using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, whereas the optimal AUROC for pre-arrest CA prediction in OHCA patients was 0.950 using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) or random forest (RF) models.

However, the growing mass of genetic and multiomics data has not been effectively explored by the drug repurposing community due to a lack of accurate approaches. This review aims to be an authoritative, critical, and accessible review and discussion of general interest to the drug repurposing community concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools. Emerging questions include what is achievable with AI in this domain and what its impact will be, what AI and ML embrace, and how we, as geneticists, pharmacologists, and computational scientists, can contribute to the discovery of new, inexpensive, and affordable repurposable medicines. The fast growth of genetics and multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and radiomics) and electronic health records in diverse populations contributes to answering questions, including how to rapidly identify effective repurposable medicines, what a clinically meaningful effect size in trials is, and what the potential implications for precision medicine are. This review discusses AI and ML for drug repurposing in the context of genetics, multiomics, real-world data collection, and crowdsourcing of knowledge.

Despite progress in protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic binders against protein targets of interest. We tested 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtained binders with medium to high affinity against all targets. For one of the targets, Rhombotarget A (RbtA), we designed a high-affinity binder (K<sub>d</sub> < 10 nM) despite starting from the predicted target structure. X-ray structures for macrocycle-bound myeloid cell leukemia 1, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-associated protein and RbtA complexes match closely with the computational models, with a Cα root-mean-square deviation < 1.5 Å to the design models.

Recent studies have identified isonicotinylation (K<sub>inic</sub>), a novel lysine acylation, as a regulatory modification influencing carcinogenic protein activity and liver cancer progression. In this study, we established the K<sub>inic</sub> Index (K<sub>inic</sub>I), an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive model that integrates multi-omics data and consensus clustering to classify HCC patients into two distinct K<sub>inic</sub> subgroups. Patients in the high-K<sub>inic</sub> subgroup exhibited significantly worse overall survival, demonstrating the value of K<sub>inic</sub>I for risk stratification and outcome prediction. Machine learning approaches (LASSO, RSF) coupled with Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis identified CYP2C9 and G6PD as the most influential prognostic variables associated with HCC progression. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses confirmed that CYP2C9 and G6PD are primarily localized in malignant hepatocytes with high metastatic potential, underscoring their clinical relevance. Importantly, using the GraphBAN deep learning framework and ADMET-AI screening, we prioritized candidate compounds targeting CYP2C9 and G6PD, followed by molecular docking that validated strong binding affinities, suggesting their potential as novel therapeutics. Together, our study demonstrates that K<sub>inic</sub>I is a powerful AI-enabled platform for prognostic modeling, molecular stratification, and multitarget drug discovery, providing a foundation for precision oncology and resistance-aware treatment strategies in HCC patients.",ai-drug-discovery,0,51.96190476190476,59.97041095890411,1

An alarming trend of rising GI malignancy diagnoses, especially in younger age groups, underscores the need for discoveries in liquid-based biomarkers that facilitate both early detection and optimal disease management. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) not only constitute promising nano-sized biomarkers, but also, via bioengineering, have shown a great therapeutic potential, with artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizing their research via the selection of the best biomarkers from omics, the recognition of pathophysiological patterns, and facilitating a faster drug-development via AI-driven EV engineering, drug delivery modeling, and target identification.

Unlike synthetic molecules engineered around single therapeutic targets, NPs often exhibit multi-target, system-level bioactivity, aligned with the principles of network pharmacology, which modulates pathways in a coordinated, non-disruptive manner. This approach reduces resistance, buffers compensatory feedback loops, and enhances therapeutic resilience. Fungal endophytes represent one of the most chemically diverse and biologically sophisticated NP reservoirs known, producing polyketides, alkaloids, terpenoids, and peptides with intricate three-dimensional architectures and emergent bioactivity patterns that remain exceptionally difficult to design de novo. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, deep learning, and multi-omics integration have redefined the discovery landscape, transforming previously intractable fungal metabolomes and cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) into tractable, predictable, and engineerable systems. AI accelerates genome mining, metabolomic annotation, BGC-metabolite linking, structure prediction, and activation of silent pathways. Generative AI and diffusion models now enable de novo design of NP-inspired scaffolds while preserving biosynthetic feasibility, opening new opportunities for direct evolution, pathway refactoring, and precision biomanufacturing. This review synthesizes the chemical and biosynthetic diversity of major NP classes from fungal endophytes and maps them onto the rapidly expanding ecosystem of AI-driven tools. We outline how AI transforms NP discovery from empirical screening into a predictive, hypothesis-driven discipline with direct industrial implications for drug discovery and synthetic biology. By coupling evolutionarily refined chemistry with modern computational intelligence, the field is poised for a new era in which natural-product leads are not only rediscovered but systematically expanded, engineered, and industrialized to address urgent biomedical and sustainability challenges.",ai-drug-discovery,0,140.40405405405406,56.31260273972603,3

Here we present a data-driven approach that integrates data mining, experimentation and machine learning to design high-performance adhesive hydrogels from scratch, tailored for demanding underwater environments. By leveraging protein databases, we developed a descriptor strategy to statistically replicate protein sequence patterns in polymer strands by ideal random copolymerization, enabling targeted hydrogel design and dataset construction. Using machine learning, we optimized hydrogel formulations from an initial dataset of 180 bioinspired hydrogels, achieving remarkable improvements in adhesive strength, with a maximum value exceeding 1 MPa. These super-adhesive hydrogels hold immense potential across diverse applications, from biomedical engineering to deep-sea exploration, marking a notable advancement in data-driven innovation for soft materials.",de-novo-protein-design,51,64.8,75.95344681881696,1
